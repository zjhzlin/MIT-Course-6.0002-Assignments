# MIT-Course-6.0002-Assignment-Problem Set 1

### 1 - Space Cows Transportation
### 2 - Golden Eggs

### Goal: 
1. Use greedy or brute force to implement cows choices that can fit onto the spaceship
2. Use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of eggs to make to a given weight for a certain ship

#### Knowledge: 
1. Knapsack problem 
2. Difference between greedy algo, brute force algo and dynamic algo

#### Learning Notes:
1. Greedy may not always yield optimal solution
2. Dynamic Algorithm - it helps to draw the tree step by step and figure out what the memo dict is

#### Possible Further Development:
- more practice on dynamic programming
