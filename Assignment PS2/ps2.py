#            13:33 - 14:30 57min debugging path - embedded list - list is mutable! need to use copy
#                          the path in the recursive need to pass the empty one
#                          still not that clear.

# 2021-04-05 06:00 - 09:00 180min debugging line by line
#        finally solved! - list is mutable. when updating the path, need to pay attention
#         wrong: path[0] += [start]           vs    correct: path[0] = path[0] + [start]
#           += doesn't create a new list;            + create a new list

# Problem 2: Building up the Campus Map
#
# Problem 2a: Designing your graph
#
# What do the graph's nodes represent in this problem? What
# do the graph's edges represent? Where are the distances
# represented?
#
# Answer:
# Each node represent each building in the MIT. And its name is the number in the 1st/2nd position in each line
# Edge represent the direct access relationship between two buildings - 1st & 2nd -> edge
# 3rd and 4th represents the total distance and weighted distance between two buildings.
