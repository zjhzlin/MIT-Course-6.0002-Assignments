# MIT-Course-6.0002-Assignment-Problem Set 2

### Fastest way to get around MIT

### Goal: 
solve a simple optimization problem on a graph. 
- find the shortest route from one building to another on the MIT campus 
- given that you wish to constrain the amount of time you spend walking outdoors (in the cold).

#### Knowledge: 
1. The concept of graph, node, edge
2. To find the shortest path: 1) Depth first search; 2) Breath first search
3. How to use recursive to implement depth first algo to find the shortest path

#### Learning Notes: 
1. The manipulation of list in python - pay special attention to whether the list is copied or not
- append and += are the same: they add the item to the list, without producing a new list. 
- using + adds the two lists and produces a new list.
